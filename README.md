## 🌟 **What's Next?**
- Added a new contributer [Yogesh](https://github.com/yogesh82-dotcom/yogesh82-dotcom) who will be responsible for frontend of the addon and creating a public community link for *streamio*. Community link would be up here soon!!!
- <ins> Use Ai to streamlining the workflow and automation. </ins>
    *Note:* This can be done rightway and easier to impliment as well with less code but the issues right now is the LLM would be fed with the entire HTML page with each costing upto ~5-10k tokens for a single which is huge. All tools like `Scrapegraph`, `Firecrawl`, `Crawl4ai` operates similarly. **I don't have the bandwidth for that much LLM tokens and also scrapping these domains weren't that complicated so As of now sticking to algorithms only. Maybe in future versions i'll incoporate it.
- Improve the Ui with featured movies, latest movies etc.
- ~~Support for more languages and domains in future updates.~~  
- Ongoing fixes for reported bugs and enhancements.
